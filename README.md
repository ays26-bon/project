This project is called DJI Catalog Explorer. It is a simple C++ console program that works like a small website menu. The purpose of this program is to help the user choose between different DJI product categories such as drones, cameras, and accessories. After selecting a category, the program shows subcategories, and then lists specific products. Finally, if the user chooses a product, the program displays some basic information about it.

The goal of this project is to practice using if/else statements, input and output, and functions in C++. It is also designed to look more interactive, so the program includes a header function that makes the text look nicer with separators and shapes. This makes it easier for the user to follow the steps.

To use this program, you need to compile it with a C++ compiler. Once the program starts, you will see a welcome screen with three main options. You type the number of the option you want, press enter, and the program will guide you to the next menu. For example, if you choose drones, you can then pick between Mini, Air/Mavic, or FPV models. Each product has simple details, like flight time, camera sensor size, or weight. 

This program can be extended or customized. For example, you can add more categories, change the products, or rewrite the product details to match new releases. The structure of the code makes it easy for a beginner to modify.

In conclusion, this project shows how to build a simple interactive menu system in C++. It connects programming practice with a real-world example by using DJI products, and it demonstrates how to use functions and branching in an organized way.
